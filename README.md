My first project in the _Hexlet_ â”€ online school programming

**Mind Games** â”€ a set of five console games based on the popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again.

**Games list**:

1. Definition of an even number
1. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated
1. Finding the Greatest Common Divisor
1. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers
1. Definition of a prime number

```bash
# For start to play, just input command in your terminal
make run-dist

# And enjoy my games ðŸŽ­
```
